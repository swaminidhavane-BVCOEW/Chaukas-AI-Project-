Chaukas AI is a dual-layered security system designed to detect and prevent UPI transaction fraud in real-time. By combining Behavioral Biometrics with Gemini AI the system creates a unique security profile for users to distinguish between legitimate owners and unauthorized actors.

 Core Functionalities
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Tracks keystroke dynamics and mouse movements to establish a user baseline.
- **AI Risk Assessment:** Integrated **Gemini 1.5 Flash** to analyze behavioral data and generate real-time risk scores.
- **Cross-Device Security:** A **Firebase-powered alert
- system** that triggers notifications to a trusted device for high-risk transactions.

 Project Structure & Deliverables
The project consists of **14 core files** organized into two primary modules:

 1. Chrome Extension (6 Files)
*Located in the `/extension` folder. Built using **Manifest V3**.*
- **manifest.json:** Extension configuration and permissions.
- **background.js:** Service worker handling API calls to Gemini and Firebase.
- **content_script.js:** Monitors user behavior (keystroke/mouse) on payment pages.
- **popup.html & popup.js:** The user interface for the security dashboard.
